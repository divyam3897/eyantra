# Collector Bot
With fully-automated farms in the future, robots can perform all the tasks like mowing, fertilizing, monitoring of pests and diseases, harvesting, tilling, etc. This also enables the farmers to just supervise the robots without the need to operate them. The key aspects of automated farms are the following:
* It reduces the demand supply mismatch
* It prevents food scarcity.
* It assists in precision crop management.
* It helps small family farmers by enabling small farms to compete globally.
* It can collect all the damaged fruits, save the major labour of the farmer and can even work 24/7 in the field which is difficult for a day to day farmour.

This repository contains the code for the Collector bot theme that 
collects the Fresh fruits fallen on the ground and avoids the Damaged fruits. An image from the overhead camera 
is processed by a Supervisor Station i.e laptop to direct the robot which then transfers the collected fruits to another robot 
referred to as Truck that moves through the farm in a given path.
